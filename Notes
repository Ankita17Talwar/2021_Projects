# When you have a time scale along the horizontal axis, the line plot is your friend

#  when you're trying to assess if there's a correlation between two variables,
#  for example, the scatter plot is the better choice
# Example  the GDP and life expectancy data for different countries in a year .
A correlation will become clear when you display the GDP per capita on a logarithmic scale.
 Add the line plt.xscale('log')

plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)
# Put the x-axis on a logarithmic scale
plt.xscale('log')
# Show plot
plt.show()
